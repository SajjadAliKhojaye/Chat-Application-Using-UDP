# ChatBox
This article is all about creating a simple chatting application using Node.JS, Express.JS, and Socket.IO. There are many different ways to implement this using traditional languages like PHP, .Net, SignalR etc. There are different libraries available in the market like chatJS, jQuery+AJAX. We can also use third-party libraries but they might be paid services. 

Here we are going to implement our own chat application which completely depends on open source technologies and is extremely easy to implement. So before going for the actual implementation lets have a look basic components of this application.
